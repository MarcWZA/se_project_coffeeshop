# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

While working on this project, cool ideas popped into my head. Like a moving animation of different ingredients being tossed up for the recipes section or animated images of different cafe meals for the menu section.
